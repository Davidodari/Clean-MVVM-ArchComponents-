# The-Force

An Android app consuming [a Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev/) to display Movie Characters
it has been built with clean architecture principles, Repository Pattern and MVVM
pattern as well as Architecture Components.

Min Api Level : 21 [Supports Over 87% Devices ](https://developer.android.com/about/dashboards)

Build System : [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)

## Prerequisite

Before running the project create a [firebase project](https://firebase.google.com/) 
and replace the **google-services.json** with yours in the `app` directory for a successful build and 
enable crashylitics.
```
package-name: com.k0d4black.theforce
```

## Architecture

The Application is split into a three layer architecture:
- Presentation
- Domain
- Data

![Architecture Flow Diagram](art/arch_flow.png)

This provides better abstractions between framework implementations 
and the underlying business logic.It requires a number of classes to get 
things running but the pros outweigh the cons in terms of building an app 
that should scale.

The 3 layered architectural approach is majorly guided by clean architecture which provides
a clear separation of concerns with its Abstraction Principle.

The `domain` and `data` layers are java module libraries as the business 
logic does not rely on the Android frameworks concrete implementations.

#### Presentation

The application presentation layer contains the Activity,Fragments and 
Viewmodels and handles Dependency Injection.

The UI layer `feature` package contains `character_detail` and 
`character_search` which contain an activity and corresponding 
viewmodel as well as other UI related classes.

The viewmodels are provided by the Koin that uses Kotlin's DSLs
to lazily resolve dependency graph at runtime

The ViewModel then receives data from the use case and updates the 
LiveData being watched by the activity,the Activity then makes updates 
to the UI as need be depending on the type of value received by the 
LiveData.This results in the **Observer Pattern** and binding of list 
data with the Recycler Views **Adapter Pattern**.

The ``UiStateViewModel`` also help coordinate the state of the UI,updating 
current view as needed using the **State Pattern** 

This pattern makes the Activities "dumb" by delegating data and logic 
operations to the Viewmodel,hence decoupling the UI layer and makes testing
components in isolation easier.

#### Domain

The domain layer contains domain model classes which represent the
data we will be handling across presentation and data layer.

Use cases are also provided in the domain layer and orchestrate the flow 
of data from the data layer onto the presentation layer and a split into
modular pieces serving one particular purpose.

#### Data

The Data layer using the **Repository Pattern**  will be able to 
provide data to the defined use cases which in this case is searching
for characters and viewing details of selected characters.The use-cases
are based on the single responsibility rule.

This provides a more decoupled system,as it is isolated from changes to the 
db by abstracting low level implementation details of data sources and
changes to the UI.

The repository classes delegate access of data to the data source of 
interest either local data source or a remote data source.

This layer also handles mapping of data entities to their domain 
representations which when eventually passed to the presentation layer the
domain will be mapped to the presentation model.

## Testing

Testing has been done based on the architectural layers.

1. Domain

Contains tests that encompass domain models and uses mockito to verify 
use cases.

2. Data

Tests in the data inherit from a base test that provides a mock web server 
with the api interface to request paths the routing of paths to responses 
is handled by a custom mock web server dispatcher.

Json responses have also been provided in the test resource folder they 
are similar to the response that will be received from the api
The repository tests serve as integration tests between the data sources
and mappers to the domain models.
Currently the data source tests serve as unit tests verifying the appropriate
responses are received from remote source.

3. Presentation

The Presentation layer contains robolectric jvm tests on for menu items 
and instrumentation tests checking on system behaviour as per user
expectation.

The UI tests display data served from a mock web server running from the
devices localhost,this removes flakiness compared to relying on actual 
data from the real server aspects such as internet connection or 
network service might bring up issues.

View models testing on live data were guided by this [article](https://proandroiddev.com/how-to-easily-test-a-viewmodel-with-livedata-and-coroutines-230c74416047)

## App Flow
 
 **Search Screen**
 
 The Search screen contains a default text view that will hint user on 
 how to search and on search they will be presented with a list of characters.
 The characters on the search result only contain a name ,birth year and url 
 that will be used to load more content if need be,this saves on loading time 
 and results in a faster search experience.
 
 The list results are bound by a recycler view and 
 each List item contains a button when on clicked navigates to 
 `CharacterDetailsActivity` screen with an Intent Extra of character url.
 
 **Details Screen**
 
 The details Screen displays character information after viewmodel receives 
 data from the usecase.The data is bound to the UI through Data binding.
 
 The Character Details are displayed by satisfying constraints to various 
 views using the constraint layout which flattens our view hierarchy and 
 avoids nesting of multiple layouts for displaying complex objects.
 
 The views displaying character data are logically  grouped by 
 constraint layout Group widget making it simpler to enable and disable 
 a large set of views.
 
## Libraries

Libraries used in the whole application are:

- [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack)ðŸš€

## Contributors

- Thanks to [Zafer Celaloglu](https://github.com/zfrc) for the Dagger to Koin Refactor.

Feel free to contribute in any way to the project.

## Extras

#### Gradle Dependencies

Centralized versioning of gradle dependencies in a global file,
```dependencies.gradle```, visible to all available modules.This helps 
maintain dependency versioning for different modules as well as improve
dependency organisation and readability by providing a clear separation
of which dependencies go where.

#### CI-Pipeline

[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/) is used for development pipeline to
automatically build and test the project every time you push updates to 
version control.

#### Code Analysis

With static code analysis you can enforce a consistent style guide on 
the project.This is possible by defining constraints with Detekt.

This Project is integrated with [Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) that 
makes use of Detekt for static code analysis on Kotlin files.You can
either configure rules from their dashboard or enforce a Detekt 
configuration locally and port it to codacy.

The rules can be configured to be checked for each pull request,commit 
or merge made.

#### Resource Values

**Fonts**

The app makes use of downloadable fonts which reduces APK size compared to
having the font files within the app.

**Dimension & String Values**

String values are stored in the strings value file this will make it 
easier for app localization and internationalization as well as string
templating currently utilised by data binding.

Dimensions have also been stored in a dimensions value file making it 
easy to reuse dimension values across the app.

**Themes & Styles**

Theming is guided by the material design specifications with a ```DayNight```
theme which can later be used to provide Night variant for the app and 
enhance user experience.
